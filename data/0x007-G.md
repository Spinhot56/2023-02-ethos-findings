## Reduce the size of error messages (Long revert Strings)
Shortening revert strings to fit in 32 bytes will decrease deployment time gas and will decrease runtime gas when the revert condition is met.
Cases can be found in `find . -name "*.sol" |xargs grep -n -E 'require.*".{36,}"'`

## Use multiple require statement instead of &&
`find . -name "*.sol" |xargs grep -n "require.*&&"`

## Mark constants as private instead of public
`find . -name "*.sol" |xargs grep -n 'public constant'`

## Pack structs into fewer storage slot
There are 2 cases in https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/main/Ethos-Core/contracts/PriceFeed.sol#L58-L71
Suggested change would be
```sol
struct ChainlinkResponse {
        uint80 roundId;
        uint8 decimals;
        bool success;
        int256 answer;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }

    struct TellorResponse {
        bool ifRetrieve;
        bool success;
        uint256 value;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }
```
