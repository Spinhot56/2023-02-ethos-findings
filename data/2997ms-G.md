## [G-01] Remove the `initializer` modifier

If we can just ensure that the `initialize()` function could only be called from within the constructor, we shouldn’t need to worry about it getting called again.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/34ba1e7dd2d259f06f9d5fa13f5d96be7829ff34/Ethos-Vault/contracts/ReaperStrategyGranarySupplyOnly.sol#L63

In the EVM, the constructor’s job is actually to return the bytecode that will live at the contract’s address. So, while inside a constructor, your address `(address(this))` will be the deployment address, but there will be no bytecode at that address. So if we check `address(this).code.length` before the constructor has finished, even from within a delegatecall, we will get 0. So now let’s update our `initialize()` function to only run if we are inside a constructor:

```
 function initialize(
        address _vault,
        address[] memory _strategists,
        address[] memory _multisigRoles,
        IAToken _gWant
    ) public initializer {           
+ require(address(this).code.length == 0, 'not in constructor');
```

Now the Proxy contract’s constructor can still delegatecall initialize(), but if anyone attempts to call it again (after deployment) through the Proxy instance, or tries to call it directly on the above instance, it will revert because address(this).code.length will be nonzero.

Also, because we no longer need to write to any state to track whether initialize() has been called, we can avoid the 20k storage gas cost. In fact, the cost for checking our own code size is only 2 gas, which means we have a 10,000x gas savings over the standard version. Pretty neat.



## [G-02] Reduce the size of error messages (Long revert Strings)

Shortening revert strings to fit in 32 bytes will decrease deployment time gas and will decrease runtime gas when the revert condition is met.

Revert strings that are longer than 32 bytes require at least one additional mstore, along with additional overhead for computing memory offset, etc.

There is no need to add the prefix in the error message.

## [G-03] Use `double require` instead of using `&&`

Using double require instead of operator && can save more gas.
When having a require statement with 2 or more expressions needed, place the expression that cost less gas first.

## [G-04] Setting the *constructor* to `payable`

You can cut out 10 opcodes in the creation-time EVM bytecode if you declare a constructor payable. Making the constructor payable eliminates the need for an initial check of `msg.value == 0` and saves `13 gas` on deployment with no security risks.

There is no need to use storage as it is only used in this function and they are temporary values.
