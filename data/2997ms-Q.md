## Summary


## Low Risk Issues

## [LOW-01] Better to set a up limit for ```totalLQTYStaked```

```
if (totalLQTYStaked > 0) {LUSDFeePerLQTYStaked = _LUSDFee.mul(DECIMAL_PRECISION).div(totalLQTYStaked);}
```

totalLQTYStaked is divided in multiple places but there is no up limit for this value. If this value becomes really large one day, all the divisions will become meaningless because all the results will be 0.

## Non Critical Issues


###  [NC-01]Open TODOs

An open TODO is present. It is recommended to avoid open TODOs as they may indicate programming errors that still need to be fixed.

**Proof Of Concept**

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/891252b407033489140de63ea502b053d5dc860c/Ethos-Core/contracts/StabilityPool.sol#L335

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Resolve these TODOs

### [NC-02]Solidity versions should be consistent

Most of solidity versions in the files are ```pragma solidity 0.6.11;```, but in ReaperStrategyGranarySupplyOnly.sol and ReaperVaultERC4626.sol
, the value is ```pragma solidity ^0.8.0;```

**Proof Of Concept**
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0
```

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Make the versions consistent
