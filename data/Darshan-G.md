> ###  Gas optimization issue in ReaperStrategyGranarySupplyOnly.sol

Summary:
In the ReaperStrategyGranarySupplyOnly.sol contract located at https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/main/Ethos-Vault/contracts/ReaperStrategyGranarySupplyOnly.sol, we identified a gas optimization issue related to the initialization of a private constant variable. Specifically, in line 35, the variable LENDER_REFERRAL_CODE_NONE is initialized with the value 0, which is redundant as Solidity assumes a default value of 0 for uint variables that are not explicitly initialized.

Impact:

This issue has a minimal impact on the functionality of the contract, but it results in unnecessary gas consumption when deploying and executing the contract.

Recommendation:
We recommend removing the redundant initialization of the LENDER_REFERRAL_CODE_NONE variable in line 35 to optimize the gas consumption of the contract. The updated code would look like this:

Solution 

     uint16 private constant LENDER_REFERRAL_CODE_NONE;

We believe that this change will not affect the behavior or functionality of the contract, as the default value of 0 will be assumed for this variable if it is not explicitly initialized.

> ### USAGE OF UINTS/INTS SMALLER THAN 32 BYTES (256 BITS) INCURS OVERHEAD
 When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.
