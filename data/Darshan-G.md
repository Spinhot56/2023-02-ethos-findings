> ###  Gas optimization issue in ReaperStrategyGranarySupplyOnly.sol

Summary:
In the ReaperStrategyGranarySupplyOnly.sol contract located at https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos/blob/main/Ethos-Vault/contracts/ReaperStrategyGranarySupplyOnly.sol, we identified a gas optimization issue related to the initialization of a private constant variable. Specifically, in line 35, the variable LENDER_REFERRAL_CODE_NONE is initialized with the value 0, which is redundant as Solidity assumes a default value of 0 for uint variables that are not explicitly initialized.

Impact:

This issue has a minimal impact on the functionality of the contract, but it results in unnecessary gas consumption when deploying and executing the contract.

Recommendation:
We recommend removing the redundant initialization of the LENDER_REFERRAL_CODE_NONE variable in line 35 to optimize the gas consumption of the contract. The updated code would look like this:

Solution 

     uint16 private constant LENDER_REFERRAL_CODE_NONE;

We believe that this change will not affect the behavior or functionality of the contract, as the default value of 0 will be assumed for this variable if it is not explicitly initialized.

> ### USAGE OF UINTS/INTS SMALLER THAN 32 BYTES (256 BITS) INCURS OVERHEAD
 When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

### Introduction
Gas optimization is a crucial aspect of smart contract development because it helps to reduce the overall cost of executing contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In Solidity, using certain operators can impact the efficiency of a contract, resulting in higher gas costs and slower execution times. This report analyzes the gas optimization issue in Solidity code where using the > 0 operator with unsigned integers is less efficient than using the != 0 operator.

### Issue Description
The gas optimization issue arises when comparing unsigned integers to zero in Solidity. Solidity optimizes the != 0 operator to a single JUMP instruction, while the > 0 operator requires two JUMP instructions. As a result, using != 0 can lead to lower gas costs and faster contract execution times.

        require(_LUSDChange > 0,  //should be != 0 
     "BorrowerOps: Debt increase requires non-zero debtChange");
     }
   


### Impact
Using the > 0 operators with unsigned integers can lead to higher gas costs and slower contract execution times, as it requires two JUMP instructions. In contrast, using the != 0 operator can reduce gas costs and speed up contract execution by optimizing the code to a single JUMP instruction.

### Conclusion
Using the != 0 operator with unsigned integers in Solidity is more efficient than using the > 0 operators. The != 0 operator optimizes code to a single JUMP instruction, while the > 0 operator requires two JUMP instructions. By using the != 0 operator, developers can reduce gas costs and improve the overall efficiency of their smart contracts.
