Testing Methodologies:

We conducted the following testing methodologies to identify potential vulnerabilities in the CollSurplusPool smart contract.

Automated Testing: We used various automated testing tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the smart contract. These tools included Slither, Mythril, Echidna, and others.

Manual Testing: We conducted manual code reviews and tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in the smart contract.

Vulnerabilities Found:

Arbitrary Transfer of Funds: The contract has a function pullCollateralFromActivePool that allows anyone to transfer any amount of ERC20 tokens to the contract. Since the function does not check if the caller has the necessary authorization to make the transfer, it can be abused to transfer tokens arbitrarily.

Re-Entrancy Vulnerability: The function claimColl has a re-entrancy vulnerability. An attacker can execute the function multiple times before the balance is updated. This can result in the attacker draining the entire contract balance.

Lack of Input Validation: The contract does not perform input validation when calling some of its functions. This can result in input being interpreted incorrectly by the contract.

Ownership Renouncement: The function setAddresses contains the line "_renounceOwnership()" which renounces the ownership of the contract. This can be dangerous as it means that no one will be able to change the contract after ownership has been renounced.

Dependency Risks: The contract imports external dependencies such as SafeMath and SafeERC20. If these dependencies have vulnerabilities, the contract can be exploited.

SafeMath is used for integer arithmetic, but it's not used for the balances mapping. Consider adding SafeMath to the balances mapping operations to avoid integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.

In the setAddresses function, consider reverting if any of the input addresses are zero addresses. A zero address as input could cause issues down the line.

In the accountSurplus and claimColl functions, consider adding a check to ensure that the _account and _collateral inputs are non-zero addresses.

The getCollateral and getUserCollateral functions expose the balance of collateral held by the contract and a specific user respectively. Consider adding access control to restrict who can call these functions, as it could leak information to unauthorized parties.

In the pullCollateralFromActivePool function, consider adding a check to ensure that the _amount input is not greater than the available balance of the _collateral asset in the active pool. This is to avoid taking more than is available in the active pool.

Consider adding more comprehensive and descriptive error messages to all the require statements, to provide better feedback to users and contract owners.

In the claimColl function, the require(claimableColl > 0, "CollSurplusPool: No collateral available to claim") check could potentially be circumvented if the _account address is a contract address that can return a non-zero value for balances[_account][_collateral]. Consider adding an additional check to ensure that the _account address is an externally owned account (EOA) to prevent this possibility.

Consider making the balances mapping public, which would remove the need for the getUserCollateral function and make the contract more transparent.

Recommendations:

Based on the vulnerabilities found, the following recommendations are made to improve the security of the CollSurplusPool smart contract:

Restrict Access to Token Transfer Function: To prevent arbitrary transfers of funds, access to the pullCollateralFromActivePool function should be restricted to authorized parties only.

Implement Checks on the claimColl Function: The claimColl function should be modified to perform balance updates before transferring tokens to prevent re-entrancy attacks.

Implement Input Validation: The contract should perform input validation when calling its functions to prevent incorrect input interpretation.

Reconsider Ownership Renouncement: The ownership renouncement should be removed to prevent an attacker from taking over the contract once ownership has been renounced.

Monitor Dependency Risks: The external dependencies should be monitored for potential vulnerabilities and updates applied if necessary.

Conclusion:

Our penetration test has identified several vulnerabilities in the CollSurplusPool smart contract. By implementing the recommendations provided, the contract can be made more secure, reducing the risk of a successful exploit. We recommend that the development team address the vulnerabilities found and conduct further tests to ensure that the contract is secure.
