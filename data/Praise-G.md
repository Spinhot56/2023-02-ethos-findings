### [G-01]- There is no need to initialize state variables to '0'. 
If a variable is not set/initialized, the default value is assumed (0, false, 0x0 â€¦ depending on the data type). You are simply wasting gas if you directly initialize it with its default value.

## Proof of Concept
```
    uint16 private constant LENDER_REFERRAL_CODE_NONE = 0;
```
