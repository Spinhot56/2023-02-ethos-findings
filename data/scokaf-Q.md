# 1: LOCK PRAGMAS TO SPECIFIC COMPILER VERSION

Vulnerability details

## Context:

Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case of contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile locally.

For reference, see https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103
